## Advanced Features Implementation

### Status Transition Engine
```python
# Valid status transitions with business logic
valid_transitions = {
    QuoteStatus.DRAFT: [QuoteStatus.SENT, QuoteStatus.DECLINED],
    QuoteStatus.SENT: [QuoteStatus.APPROVED, QuoteStatus.DECLINED, QuoteStatus.EXPIRED],
    QuoteStatus.APPROVED: [QuoteStatus.DECLINED],  # Can decline after approval
    QuoteStatus.DECLINED: [],  # Terminal state
    QuoteStatus.EXPIRED: [QuoteStatus.SENT],  # Can resend expired quotes
}
```

### Financial Calculation Engine
```python
def calculate_totals(self):
    """Precise financial calculations with proper rounding."""
    subtotal = sum(item.total_price for item in self.line_items.all())
    tax_amount = subtotal * self.tax_rate
    total_amount = subtotal + tax_amount
    
    # Round to 2 decimal places with banker's rounding
    self.subtotal = subtotal.quantize(Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)
    self.tax_amount = tax_amount.quantize(Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)
    self.total_amount = total_amount.quantize(Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)
```
